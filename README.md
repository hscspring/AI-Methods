# GeneralAI

一直对 AI 情有独钟，学习算法半年有余，感觉各方面知识过于庞杂：机器学习、深度学习、强化学习、GAN、传统算法……数不胜数，故决定构建自己的 AI 算法体系。  

恰好看到 [MIT 的人工智能课程](http://open.163.com/movie/2017/9/Q/S/MCTMNN3UI_MCTMNR8QS.html)，看了课程介绍觉得欲罢不能，决定就从这里开始。  


## AI 简史

- 1842: Lady Lovelace, First programmer
- 1950: Turing, Turing Test Paper
- 1960: Marvin Minsky, 《Steps toward Aitificial Intelligence》   
- 1970-2000: 
	- early DAWN age  
		- James Slagle, a program did symbolic integration（积分程序）  
		- Another: Eliza  
		- Another: analogy  
	- Late dawn
		- vision
		- learning
		- expert systems: Bizs, Deep Blue
	- BULLDOZER time

## What Is AI?  

- THINKING, PERCEPTION, ACTION: LOOPS TOGETHER
- MODELS TARGETED AT
- REPRESENTATIONS THAT SUPPORT 
- CONSTRAINTS EXPOSED BY
- ALGORITHMS ENABLED BY


### GENERATE AND TEST

- Generating some possible solutions
- feeding them into a box that test them
- out the other side comes mostly failures, but every once in a while we get something that succeeds and pleases us.


### Rumpelstiltskin principal  

once you can name something, you get power over it.

### Lauguage

Lauguage is at the center of thins because oit enables storytelling going up, and marshaling the resources of the perceptual apparatus that are lying down. 
语言处在一切的中心，它向上让故事讲述成为可能，并向下统御感觉系统的各种资源。
